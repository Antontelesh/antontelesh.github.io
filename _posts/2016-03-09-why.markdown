Last month I started to find more and more twitter messages and blog posts encouraging people to start writing about development.
They say writing is essential for learning and also one of the ways to contribute to open source.

The last straw was [Todd Motto's talk at NG-NL](https://youtu.be/oO0b7iplgYY) where he tells that everyone has something to teach others.

Now I'm in vacation and finally have enough time to spend it on learning.
So I decided to start this blog to put my knowledge in order and to share it with you.
Maybe something that is useful for me can be useful for you too. Hope so.

My current plan is to release one post per week, where I can share the things I've learned during that week.

I will appreciate your feedback in comments below each blog post.
