Hi!
My name is Anton Telesh.
I'm a lead software engineer at EPAM Systems.

I'm passionate about functional programming, reactive programming and OOP.
I write JavaScript and some of the languages that compile to it: TypeScript, ReasonML, ClojureScript and Elm.

I develop web applications since 2012.
