Hi!
My name is Anton Telesh.
I'm a senior software engineer at EPAM Systems.

I'm passionate about functional programming. This blog will contain posts mostly about this paradigm of programming.
I'm feeling confident with JavaScript and some languages that compile to it. Also learning Elm and Haskell.

I have four years of experience in developing web applications.
Consider myself an expert in AngularJS and React.
For JS development I use Babel, CoffeeScript, Webpack.

Also I'm interested in playing music and photographing.
