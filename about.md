Hi!
My name is Anton Telesh. I'm busy in software engineering since 2012.
My career experience now consists of only one company — Smart Cloud Solutions Ltd. — where I've grown up to Frontend Team Lead.

I'm passionate about functional programming. This blog will contain posts mostly about this paradigm of programming.
I'm feeling confident with JavaScript and some languages that compile to it. Also learning Elm and Haskell.

Have a lot of experience in developing web applications on top of AngularJS and React.
For JS development I use Babel, CoffeeScript, Webpack.

Also I'm interested in playing music and photographing.
